# Akulla.lua
My personal discord bot, I'm using it to complete others bot functions. So it's not a big bot.
It's made in lua, with Discordia : https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia
I'm also using the string lua library from gmod : https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod/blob/master/garrysmod/lua/includes/extensions/string.lua#L265
